# Blinter extension progress

version: 2
repository: Blinter VS Code extension (local workspace)
root: c:\Users\philip\sauce\blinter-vscode-extension
owner: unspecified
last_updated: 2026-02-22T14:40:00Z

current_state:
- Extension uses `blinter-debug` inline adapter flow with diagnostics, hovers, suppressions, and output webview in `extension.js`.
- Severity handling is now consistent (`error`, `warning`, `information`, `hint`) across parser, analyzer, and UI summary grouping.
- Lint execution path uses shared spawn helper with stale-run guards to reduce race conditions and stale diagnostic updates.
- Unit and integration suites are passing locally.
- Full test matrix command (`npm run test:matrix`) now executes all requested testing categories and writes reports to `test/reports/`.

recent_execution:
- Ran `npm run lint`: pass.
- Ran `npm run test:unit`: pass.
- Ran `npm run test:integration`: pass.
- Ran `npm run test:matrix`: pass across unit, integration, system, UAT, regression, performance, security, smoke, sanity, exploratory.

artifacts_generated:
- `test/reports/test-matrix-latest.md`
- `test/reports/test-matrix-latest.json`
- `test/reports/performance-latest.json`
- `test/reports/uat-latest.json`
- `tmp/system-test.vsix`

open_items:
- UAT manual checklist still has pending user-verified items:
  - create/open `blinter.ini` flow in a real user workspace
  - status bar indicator behavior in manual UX pass
  - click-through navigation validation from output list under manual workflow

next_actions (for next agent):
1. Complete remaining manual UAT checklist items in `test/UAT_CHECKLIST.md`.
2. Decide whether to include `npm run test:matrix` in CI or keep as local release gate.
3. If desired, clean historical encoding artifacts in old generated logs/docs that still contain mojibake.
